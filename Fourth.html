      <h1>London adventure</h1>
      <p>This is a collection of photos from July 2023 when I went to London with my dad. We traveled to London to see the St. Louis Cardinals play against the Chicago Cubs as part of the MLB World Tour, but we also spent a week visiting several popular monuments.</p>

     <img src="img/church.jpg" alt="A large, 12-foot-tall sculpture of a perfectly round human eyeball sits on a patchy field.">
      <figcaption>
        This is me and my dad in St. Paulâ€™s Cathedral. This was our first stop, on the first day of our adventure around the city.

    <figure class="gallery-image hideThis">
      <img src="img/bridge.jpg"  alt="A small bronze sculpture of a human eye sits on a podium. In the background is a comically large colored version of that eyeball a patchy field.">
      <figcaption>
       Stop number 2! This is a photo of me pointing at Tower Bridge, as any normal American tourist would. I learned the hard way that this is NOT the same thing as London Bridge.

    <figure class="gallery-image hideThis">
     <img src="img/stonehenge.jpg"  alt="Various red cylinders are stacked around and on top of one another haphazardly on a grassy hill, with the cylinders pointing in different directions.">
      <figcaption>
        The next day, we took a bus tour that traveled to Salisbury Plain where we saw Stonehenge. Here, you can see yet another photo of me pointing at what is obviously behind me.

    <figure class="gallery-image hideThis">
     <img src="img/buckingham.jpg"  alt="A large sculpture with various red cylinders stacked around and on each other on a barren field. In front is a miniature of that sculpture on a podium.">
      <figcaption>
       Day number 3! My dad and I made it to Buckingham Palace in time to see the changing of the guard, an almost daily but famous ceremony.
      </figcaption>

    <figure class="gallery-image hideThis">
      <img src="img/dadbigben.jpg"  alt="A comically huge tire sits partially buried in mulch on a patchy field. A sign nearby says, 'No climbing on sculpture. Punishable to fullest extent.'">
      <figcaption>
     On Day 4, I took this photo of my dad standing in front of the Thames River, and of course, Big Ben and the beautiful Westminster Abbey.

  <img src="img/westham.jpg" alt="A comically huge tire sits partially buried in mulch on a patchy field. A sign nearby says, 'No climbing on sculpture. Punishable to fullest extent.'">
      <figcaption>
     Finally game day! As our trip came to a close, our final destination for the trip was West Ham Stadium. This was the location of the Cardinals vs Cubs baseball game, where we won (in spirit).
